Register is an Android library for easier testing of Google Play billing

### The Problems:

+ In App Billing implementations on Android are  hard to get right
+ When payments are involved developers sleep better having a way to test their functionality prior to release
+ Before an App is promoted to Alpha within the Play Store we do not have an offical way to test payments

The New York Times Android Team developed a fake implementation of Google Play Store's In-App Billing called Register
which can be used as a companion app for In-App Billing purchases and subscriptions.  Similar to a mock web server, 
you can point your app to use Register rather than the real Play Store Billing implementation.  Using register you'll be able to validate whether your purchasing flows work correctly.  

Register has been used to test purchasing flows of our [Flagship Reader App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nytimes.android&hl=en) 
and  [NYT Crosswords App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nytimes.crossword&hl=en) for 3 years

### Overview

Register is a library and companion app that allow seamless mocking of responses from Google in app billing. 
Register works by implementing the same interface as Googleâ€™s in app billing library [InApp Billing Service](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-play-billing/blob/master/TrivialDrive/app/src/main/aidl/com/android/vending/billing/IInAppBillingService.aidl)
From a clients perspective there is no difference in how you work with Google's In App Billing or Register's implementation.

If you've used [Amazon's IAP tester utility](https://developer.amazon.com/public/apis/earn/in-app-purchasing/docs-v2/testing-iap), 
you'll find Register's workflow to be very familiar.

### Using Register

**Step 0:** Register needs a configuration file that declares mock purchases, subscriptions and users that you will be testing against.  

Here's a sample that we use at NYTimes, the format needs to be same as below when creating your own fake purchases
```json
{
	"skus": {
	    "register.sample.iap": {
			"itemType": "IN APP PURCHASE",
			"price" : "1.00",
			"title" : "Sample In App Purchase Item",
			"description" : "This is an in app purchase item for use with Register sample app",
			"package" : "com.nytimes.android.external.register"
	    },
		"register.sample.sub": {
			"itemType": "SUBSCRIPTION",
			"price" : "10.00",
			"title" : "Sample Subscription Item1",
			"description" : "This is a subscription item for use with Register sample app",
			"package" : "com.nytimes.android.external.register"
		}
	},
	"users": [
		"user1@register.nytimes.com",
		"user2@register.nytimes.com"
	]
}

```
**Step 1:** `adb push register.json /sdcard/` where `register.json` is a json file in the same format as above

**Step 2:** Install `RegisterCompanion` onto the phone that wants to mock the In App Billing, 
you can find the latest version in the [Release Tab](https://github.com/nytm/Register/releases)

**Step 3:** Add Register as a dependency to your client app 
```groovy 
compile 'com.nytimes.android.register:0.0.1'
```

or, on Android Gradle Plugin 3.0 or later:

```groovy 
implementation 'com.nytimes.android.register:0.0.1'
```

**Step 4:** Create a test google services provider(or a real provider)

```java
 private void initGoogleServiceProvider() {
        if (prefsManager.isUsingTestGoogleServiceProvider()) {
            googleServiceProvider = new GoogleServiceProviderTesting();
        } else {
            googleServiceProvider = new GoogleServiceProviderImpl();
        }
    }
```

**Step 5:** Make a purchase similar to how you work with the regular play store In App Billing API 

![Register Sample](https://github.com/nytm/register/blob/master/images/purchase.png?raw=true)

**Step 6:** Go to your companion app to see the purchase

### Fully Configurable (Configuration App)
Register's Companion App allows you to see purchases that were 
successfully or unsuccessfully made directly on your android device.  
Additionally you can control responses back to your client app for values such as `getSkuDetails` 
See image below for all configurable options on a response

![Register Sample](https://github.com/nytm/register/blob/master/images/registerCompanion.png?raw=true)

### Sample App

**SampleApp** is a client app to showcase working with Register 
See [SampleActivity](https://github.com/nytm/Register/blob/master/sampleApp/src/main/java/com/nytimes/android/external/register/sample/SampleActivity.java) for a demo  purchasing flow

### Gradle

**For Android Gradle Plugin 3.0**

```groovy 
implementation 'com.nytimes.android.register:0.0.1'
```

**for project using older versions of the plugin**

```groovy
compile 'com.nytimes.android.register:0.0.1'
```
